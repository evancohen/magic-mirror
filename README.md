# Smart Mirror
This project is inspired by [HomeMirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) and Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror). It uses [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) for voice interactivity, integrates with Philips Hue, and is my own take on what a "smart mirror" can be.

##### Why start from scratch?
Starting from scratch was less about other projects not being good enough and more about my own learning experience. While I did get a lot of inspiration from other projects I really wanted this to be my own!

##### Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi (running Chromium)
- USB Microphone
- Monitor (with the bezel removed)
- Mirror Pane (aka Observation Glass)
- Philips Hue

##### Take it for a spin:
Check it out: [https://evancohen.github.io/smart-mirror/](https://evancohen.github.io/smart-mirror/).
The version running on this link has limited functionality: No Hue or Weather since config.js is not included in the source of this project and contains service keys, which I will not be posting.

##### More info:
Favicon from [In the Wake of the King](http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2014/03/17/in-the-wake-of-the-king/), a head nod to **The Watcher** â€“ "A byblow of the king and a queen of the sea, she has remained apart from the workings of her family, more home beneath the waves, watching all through water and mirror. Her ambitions lie outside the Eternal Kingdom, but her secrets are valuable everywhere."

Awesome.
