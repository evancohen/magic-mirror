#### Gitter:
A live chat to get help and discuss mirror related issues: https://gitter.im/evancohen/smart-mirror. Usually there are a few folks hanging around in the lobby, but if there arent you are probubly better off [filing an issue](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror/issues/new).

=======
### Getting Started
#### Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 2**
- USB Microphone (Or Webcam w/ microphone)
- Monitor (with the bezel removed)
- Mirror Pane (aka Observation Glass)
- Philips Hue

** Also compatible with other Linux, Windows, and OSX devices. See the `cordova` branch for Android and iOS compatibility.

#### Installation
In order to get started I suggest a clean install of Raspbian. You can snag a fresh copy of Jessie (recommended, it's the future) or Wheezy from the [Raspbian Download Page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

You'll also need to install Node (v4.0.0+) which now comes bundled with npm.
```
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.0.0/node-v4.0.0-linux-armv7l.tar.gz 
tar -xvf node-v4.0.0-linux-armv7l.tar.gz 
cd node-v4.0.0-linux-armv7l
```
Copy to /usr/local
```
sudo cp -R * /usr/local/
```

##### Getting the code
Next up you'll want to clone this repository into your user's home folder on your Pi:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror.git
```

##### Configuring the mirror
You'll need to fill in a few things into `config.js`, which should end up looking something like this:
``` javascript
var config = {
    lenguage : "en",
    greeting : ["Hi, sexy!", "Hey There!", "Looking Awesome!"],
    forcast : {
        key : "a6s5dg39j78qj38sjs91je9djadfa1e",
        units : "auto"
    },
    hue : {
        ip : "192.168.1.99",
        uername : "as9234ho0dfhoq01f2as3yh4m0",
        group : "0",
    },
    calendar: {
      icals : ["https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/SOMESTUFF/basic.ics",
"https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/SOMESTUFF/reachcalendar.ics"],
      maxResults: 9,
      maxDays: 365
    },
    giphy: {
      key : "a6s5dg39j78qj38sjs91je9djadfa1e"
    },
    traffic: {
      key : "a6s5dg39j78qj38sjs91je9djadfa1e",
      mode : "Driving",
      origin : "350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118",
      destination : "1 Dr Carlton B Goodlett Pl, San Francisco, CA 94102",
      name : "work",
      reload_interval : 5
    }
}
```
Note that if you start the mirror and get a black screen you most likeley have an issue with your config.

##### Configuring the Pi
In order to rotate your monitor you'll need to add the following line to `/boot/config.txt`
```
display_rotate=1
```
You can also set this value to '3' to have a flipped vertical orientation.

In order to disable the screensaver you'll want to comment out (with a '#') the `@xscreensaver` and `@lxpanel` lines in `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart`. You'll also want to add the following lines to that same file
```
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
```

##### Install dependencies and run
Before we can run the thing we've got to install the projects dependencies. From the root of the `smart-mirror` directory run:
```
npm install
```

This will take a minute, it has to download [electron-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/electron-prebuilt). Once that is done you can launch the mirror with
```
npm start
```

#### Development
>>>>>>> config file is now in the root
To launch the mirror with a debug window attached use the following command:
```
npm start dev
```
For more information see the [Development and Contributing](http://docs.smart-mirror.io/docs/development_and_contributing.html) section of the documentation.

### More info
Favicon from [In the Wake of the King](http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2014/03/17/in-the-wake-of-the-king/), a head nod to **The Watcher** â€“ "A byblow of the king and a queen of the sea, she has remained apart from the workings of her family, more home beneath the waves, watching all through water and mirror. Her ambitions lie outside the Eternal Kingdom, but her secrets are valuable everywhere."

Awesome.
